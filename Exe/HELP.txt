Hey!
In case these files dont work, or are out of date, or you just want to double check I didnt mess up
and forget to upload the changed .exe folder as well, to find the 100% guarenteed changed .exe, you should
go into the folder of the program you want to open, open the obj folder, open 64x, then chose release, or
debug (I prefer release just because why not), then open the .exe there!
Thanks!
